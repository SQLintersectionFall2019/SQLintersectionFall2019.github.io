Kimberly’s an author, consultant, and top-rated speaker having spoken at PASS, TechEd, and numerous events around the world. She has over 25 years of experience designing and tuning SQL Server solutions with a focus on optimizing procedural code, indexing strategies, statistics, and VLDB design. When she's not tuning SQL servers, she's probably on, around, or under water – photographing all sorts of critters such as frogfish with her husband, Paul S. Randal.
