SQLintersection is packed with technical, full-day workshops over 3 days (2 preconference days and 1 post-conference day) as well as numerous of real-world inspired and technology-focused sessions (NOT marketing) by top speakers who consult and work in the trenches as you do. Youâ€™ll learn proven, problem-solving techniques and technologies you can implement immediately as well as learn about the future of SQL Server. Our primary conference focus is around performance monitoring, troubleshooting, designing for scale and performance, cloud, as well as how to leverage key new features in SQL Server 2017 and higher! Even in our short time together, we will leverage our unique, yet real-world experiences and pull together the best information to give you the biggest gains!

And, unlike some other conferences, SQLintersection speakers are all real-world consultants, members of the Microsoft product development or Microsoft customer service / support teams who are also known as the best speakers in the SQL Server community! If you want practical development from REAL experts who can really teach you HOW to do things RIGHT, this is the place to be!
